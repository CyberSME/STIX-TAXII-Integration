# STIX-TAXII-Integration
The following scripts are designed to automatically convert the weekly MS-ISAC Malicious IPs and domains in to firewall rules or IDS/IPS signatures. This is done by querying our attacking IP and Domain API feed. If you wish to gain access to the API, please email a request to soc@msisac.org.
