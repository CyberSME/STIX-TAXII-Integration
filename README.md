# STIX-TAXII-Integration
The STIX-TAXII-Integration scripts are designed to automatically convert the weekly MS-ISAC Malicious IPs and domains in to firewall rules or IDS/IPS signatures. This is done by querying the MS-ISAC Soltra Edge STIX/TAXII feeds. If you wish to gain access to the feeds, please email a request to soc@msisac.org. 

Further usage documentation is available for your firewal or IDS/IPS solution:
